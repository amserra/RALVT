				'RALVT, Lisbon and Tagus Valley Stranding Network, started operating in 2021 and is part of the National Network of Arrojamentos, operating between the region of Lisbon and Tagus Valley, between the municipalities of Lourinhã and Setúbal. It is the result of a partnership between the Environmental Fund, ICNF (Institute for Nature Conservation and Forests) and MARE - ISPA (Higher Institute of Applied Psychology). Our main objective is to respond to alerts of dead or live strandings of cetaceans and sea turtles that occur in our area of operation.',

These animals are also called cetaceans and belong to the order Cetartiodactyla. They are an extremely diverse group, having different dialects and hierarchical structures, feeding and routines. Cetaceans are divided into two groups, the odontocetes or toothed whales and the mysticetes or baleen whales. These animals have a very significant ecological representativeness, being greatly impacted by various anthropogenic activities such as: pollution, accidental fishing, maritime traffic and by activities that interrupt feeding and reproduction events.',

			text: 'A stranding is when a marine animal, dead or alive, runs aground on the shore and cannot return to the water without assistance. The most common stranded animals are cetaceans (whales and dolphins), sea turtles and seabirds. This phenomenon has become increasingly common in Portugal, but also in other places in the world, such as France, Scotland and Ireland. However, we have to take into account that the number of entities registering this type of phenomena is increasing, as well as more and more people are aware to alert these events.',
			aliveStranding: {
				title: 'Alive stranding',
				text: "Live strandings are very complex situations and each situation will be different. Usually, animals that are live stranded on beaches are no longer in the best health conditions and, therefore, the outcome of a live stranding is not always the survival of the animal and its return to the ocean. The goal is always to assess the health status of the animal, and make a decision on what is the best option to reduce the animal's suffering and how we can avoid inducing further stress."
