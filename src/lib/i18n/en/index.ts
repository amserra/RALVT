				'The Lisbon and Tagus Valley Stranding Network (Rede de Arrojamentos de Lisboa e Vale Tejo – RALVT), started operating in 2021 and belongs to the National Stranding Network, acting in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley region, between Lourinhã and Setúbal. This network is the result of a collaboration between MARE-ISPA (Centro de Ciências do Mar e Ambiente – Instituto Superior de Psicologia Avançada), ICNF (Instituto de Conservação da Natureza e Florestas) and Fundo Ambiental (Ministério do Ambiente). Our main goal is to respond to warnings of marine mammals and sea turtles strandings (whether the animal is alive or not) that occur in our region.'

			title: 'Our mission',
			text1:
				'RALVT is composed by a multidisciplinary team of marine biologists and veterinary doctors. The collaboration between these areas of expertise allows us to have a better response to the strandings and have a broader knowledge of the species we work with. We are a group of people interested in the oceans and the biodiversity within them and with a collective goal for the conservation of these species and for passing on our knowledge and passion of marine life to the rest of the population.',

				liveSightings: {
					title: 'Assistance to live strandings.',
					text: 'We operate on a 24/7 schedule, which allows RALVT to respond to live strandings. In these cases, our number one priority is to stabilize the animal and make it as comfortable as possible.'
				},
				monitorings: {
					title: 'Monitoring.',
					text: 'By regularly monitoring the beaches in our region, we can collect systematic information, allowing us to also detect some strandings before they are reported. Besides that, these reconnaissance missions allows us to map the beach morphology in order to plan the best routes, especially in areas of difficult access in order to have a faster response time.'
				},
				education: {
					title: 'Environmental education.',
					text: 'We want to promote ocean literacy with environmental education, science projects, training sessions and webminars with the general population and by collaborating with local organizations. Additionally, we have volunteer programs and curricular internships that allow us to work with students that are interested in exploring this subject.'

Cetaceans are an extremely diverse group, possessing different dialects, social structures, routines and feeding habits. Cetaceans are divided into two groups, Odontoceti or toothed whales and Mysticeti or baleen whales. These animals have a very significant ecological representativeness, and are severely impacted by various anthropogenic activities, such as pollution, bycatching, trafficking and by activities that interrupt breeding or feeding events.',

Generally speaking, they are found in pods of hundreds of individuals. Common dolphins are considered very agile and develop areal behaviours, often interacting with ships in a behaviour called “bow riding”. They feed mainly on fish and cephalopods (squid and octopi). Their average lifespan is 35 years.'

Female turtles return to their birthplace in order to make their nests.',

Their wingspan can measure up to 110cm and they can weigh up to 2500g. The cormorant can spend more than a minute underwater; however, their feathers aren’t waterproof creating the need to dry after a dive.'

				title: 'Live stranding',
				text: 'Live strandings are very complex situations, and each case is different and unique. Usually, animals that beach alive aren’t very healthy and for this reason it may not always be possible to return them to the sea. The main goal is always to assess the animal’s heath status and the viability of its recovery/refloating. In cases where the recovery/refloating of the animal is not viable, measures are taken to reduce its suffering.'
